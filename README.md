# FEMHACK
Femhack Hackathon | Individual one-day challenge | Data Science

The challenge for the data scientists was to explore and analyse the value of the euro in relation to the pound sterling going out of Europe. Moreover, to improve the European central bank's decision making led by Christine Lagarde, some certainty about future EUR/GBP pair currency market dynamics were needed. For this, in groups, we generated a predictive classification model to predict whether the monetary value will rise or fall.
